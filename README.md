Share a view only link
You can create view only link from mobile device. ARES Touch is a CAD Application runs on Mobile devices.

You can share a ‘Read-only’ link but only for your cloud storage based drawings. The link will open the drawing in ARES Kudo (a web based CAD Application) with ‘Read-only’ permission.

NOTE: From local storage drawings, you can share the drawing file, but not the link.

You will find the option in ‘Contextual’ menu of cloud based file, named ‘Send a link’.

ARES Touch Send a link

ARES Kudo is also nicely improving collaboration with your customers and partners.  Nothing to install, nothing to pay, nothing to update, you will just click on the link and see your DWG file in their Internet browser.
